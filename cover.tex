\section{Dear Hiring Manager, Andrew, and Kian}
\par
\large{
I am interested in the Learning Developer role at Workera.ai. I have nearly five years of experience developing data-driven solutions to diverse problems in academia and the industry. Further, I have experience designing and curation education material in the AI and data science domain. I hope this letter convinces you that I am passionate about a data-driven future, education, and have the necessary skills to make your clients passionate about it too!

As my CV indicates, I am good at connecting the dots between multiple disciplines. In particular, I have a bachelor in electrical engineering which gives me a technical foundation in engineering, a MSc. in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with a PhD in applying state of the art causal AI to understand and predict human behaviour. 


% Most of my recent work has involved using tools such as auto-encoders, graphical models, generalised additive models and time-series models such as Hidden Markov Models to understand, model, and forecast high frequency sequential data.  My favourite tool to work with is R and Python (for examples, \href{https://github.com/nbhushan/QDHMMrepo/blob/master/qdhmm.py}{ click here}). I am familiar with SQL, Power BI, high-performance computing and I am eager to learn and teach any additional tools that may help deliver results.

Relevant to this position, my most recent industry experience is at Breda University of Applied Sciences where I was responsible for designing the curriculum for a new study program in Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In simple terms, I had to decide what knowledge and skills do students need to learn, how can they master the required skills, and how do we decide if they have indeed mastered the required skills. Adopting a project-based didactical approach (using Github as a LMS), I developed a curriculum that drives students to apply theoretical concepts learned to real-world problems. Further, oby btaining the teaching qualification certification which keeps me up-to-date with the latest pedagogical and didactical skills, I am certified as an educator in the Netherlands. 

Also relevant to this position is my previous experience at Bosch Transmission Technologies (automotive \& manufacturing) as an industry 4.0 data scientist and internal data science consultant. I was largely responsible for enabling AI in the organisation by providing comprehensive training on AI (computer vision) and Machine learning topics via Skype (due to Covid19). Further, I was largerely responsible for rolling out end-to-end BI solutions (based on the Microsoft stack) to enable key users in various departments such as sales, purchasing, logistics and production to monitor key KPIs and receive early warning signals.

% In addition, I have also delivered lectures in statistical inference and regression modelling to first year students (>100) in psychology during my PhD at the university of Groningen. Further, I have supervised bachelor as well as master thesis in AI and data science topics. One of the thesis topics also resulted in a publication in a top-tier journal - \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01050/full}{ click here})

I believe that I possess the required competencies to be good at this position - a technical foundation in AI and data science along with an affinity to the behavioural sciences- demonstrated experience in learning and management- relevant experience with education and experience in curating relevant content. 

% Further, my dutch is at the B1 level and will definitely improve with practise.
 

I have enclosed my CV for your reference. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to talking to you a cup of coffee and knowing more about this position!}\\
